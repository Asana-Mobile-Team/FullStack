## 1. Service Responsibilities
- Send notifications (push, email, in-app) to users.
- Expose REST endpoints for notification triggers.
- Integrate with messaging services (e.g., Firebase, SMTP).

## 2. API Guidelines
- Use JSON for all requests and responses.
- Document endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI.
- Example (Java Spring):
  ```java
  @PostMapping("/api/notify")
  public ResponseEntity<Void> sendNotification(@RequestBody NotificationRequest req) {
      // ...
      return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
  }
  ```

## 3. Integration
- Store credentials in environment variables.
- Use async processing for sending notifications.

## 4. Best Practices
- Comment code, especially for integration logic.
- Write tests for notification flows.
- Log notification events and errors.
