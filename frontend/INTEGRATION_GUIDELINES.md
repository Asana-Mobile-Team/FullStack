## 1. Connecting to Backend APIs
- Use `fetch` or `axios` to call backend REST endpoints.
- Always handle errors and display user-friendly messages.
- Store API URLs in environment variables (e.g., `.env`).
- Use async/await for cleaner code.

## 2. Integrating YouTube Recommendations
- Use the backend to proxy YouTube Data API requests for security.
- Display video recommendations in a user-friendly UI.
- Handle loading and error states gracefully.

## 3. State Management
- Use React Context, Redux, or Zustand for global state.
- Keep UI state and server state separate.

## 4. UI/UX Best Practices
- Follow Asanaâ€™s design patterns for navigation and usability.
- Use consistent colors, fonts, and spacing (see `constants/Colors.ts`).
- Test on both iOS and Android devices/emulators.

## 5. General Tips
- Comment your code, especially for API calls and complex logic.
- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- Write tests for components and API logic.
- Use logging for debugging (e.g., `console.log`, but remove before production).
- Keep the README up to date for onboarding new team members.
